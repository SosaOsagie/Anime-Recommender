The anime recommender system utilizes various techniques to provide personalized recommendations for anime shows to users. The system typically follows these steps:

1. Data Collection: Gather a dataset of anime shows, including attributes such as titles, genres, ratings, and user preferences. This data can be obtained from online sources or through APIs.

2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and normalize the data. This step may involve techniques like data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering.

3. Feature Extraction: Convert textual data (e.g., anime titles, genres) into numerical representations using vectorization techniques. Common methods for this include word embedding models (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) or TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) encoding.

4. Similarity Computation: Calculate the similarity between anime shows based on their numerical representations. One common approach is to use the sigmoid kernel, which measures the similarity between two vectors and maps the similarity values to a range between 0 and 1.

5. User Profile Creation: Gather information about the user's preferences and create a user profile based on their interactions with the system, such as ratings or viewed anime shows.

6. Recommendation Generation: Apply collaborative filtering techniques, utilizing the computed similarity scores and the user profile, to generate personalized anime recommendations. This involves finding anime shows that are similar to the user's preferences and have high similarity scores.

By utilizing vectorization techniques and the sigmoid kernel, the recommender function transforms textual data into numerical representations, measures similarity between anime shows, and generates personalized recommendations based on user preferences and system data.
